    <h4>Tasty, quick, chicken thighs, with juicy meat and a crispy 
        skin;<br> you will love this chicken that is ready for the table 
        in less than 30 minutes!</h4>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skin-on, boneless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Pat chicken thighs dry with a paper towel and brush the skin-side 
            of each piece with olive oil.<br> Place chicken thighs, skin-side down, in a single layer on a plate.</li>
        <li>Combine smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl and sprinkle half the <br>seasoning
             mixture evenly over the 4 chicken thighs. Turn thighs over and evenly sprinkle <br>remaining seasoning
             mixture on top. Place chicken thighs in the air fryer basket in a single layer, skin-side up.</li>
        <li>Fry in the preheated air fryer until chicken is brown and juices run clear, about 18 minutes. An instant-read 
            <br>thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
