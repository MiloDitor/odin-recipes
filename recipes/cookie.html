    <h3>This is a recipe on how to make a <br>chocolate chip cookie!</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 cup milk chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1 (3 ounce) bar dark chocolate, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine brown sugar, butter, white sugar, and salt in a large bowl; <br> beat with 
            an electric mixer until a creamy, deep brown mixture forms. <br> Add egg and vanilla;
             beat until mixture lightens and becomes smooth, 10 to 15 seconds.</li>
        <li>Mix flour and baking soda together in a separate bowl. Add slowly to the wet ingredients 
            until <br>mostly incorporated, but some white traces of flour remain. Fold in milk chocolate, 
            dark chocolate, <br> and white chocolate using a spatula, not the mixer. Cover the dough and 
            refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 48 hours. </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) when ready to bake.</li>
        <li>Divide cold dough into 2 1/4-ounce portions and place on a cookie sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the edges start to look golden brown and crispy, 10 to 12 minutes.
             Do not overbake; the centers <br>will not look fully done. Cool until cookies are set, about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
