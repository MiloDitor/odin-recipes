    <h1>Miso Soup</h1>
    <img src="../imgs/misosoup.jpeg"></img>
    <h4>
        Dashi is a basic stock used in Japanese cooking which is made 
        by boiling dried kelp (seaweed)<br> and dried bonito (fish). Instant 
        dashi granules are sold in conveniently-sized jars or packets<br> and
         vary in strength. Add more dashi to your soup if you want a 
         stronger stock. You can use <br>yellow, white or red miso paste for 
         this soup. Yellow miso is sweet and creamy, red miso is stronger 
         and saltier.</h4>
